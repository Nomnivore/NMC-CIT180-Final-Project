        <h2>What is Geocaching?</h2>
        <p>
          Geocaching is an outdoor treasure-hunt style activity where your goal is to find
          containers, or 'caches', hidden by other players all around the world. Caches can be found
          in just about every city or county - it's as simple as downloading the <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play/mobile">mobile app</a>
          and checking the map to see what's near you. Using the app, you can see the details of any cache including
          difficulty (based on terrain, how well it's hidden, and other factors), size of the container, hints for finding it, and logs posted
          by other players who have found or searched for that cache. It is surprising to learn just how many can be found in places you've walked 
          right by countless times; under streetlight skirts, in a clearing by a walking trail, on the back of signposts, and much more. The heart of geocaching
          is appreciating and preserving nature, so no digging or destruction of any ground or property
          should be necessary for finding a cache. This allows you to go hunt for a cache almost anytime - 
          no need for special tools to retrieve it (in most cases!).
        </p>
        <h3>What's in a cache?</h3>
        <p>Upon finding and opening a cache, you will find an assortment of items and trinkets,
          based on the container's size and what other players have left inside. There will always be
          a paper log for you to sign and date your name, as proof of your successful discovery. In non-miniature-sized
          caches, you can additionally find little collectibles or trinkets that other players have traded
          or left inside. You may even stumble upon a 'trackable', which is a special trinket that is brought
          from cache to cache by many different people, with each activity being logged on the website
          using its unique identifier. It could have made its way from across the globe!
